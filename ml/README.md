# ML Repository for Project Work in Course 4DV652

In this repository, team members work on assignment tasks related to data processing and machine learning training.

Each member has a Jupyter Notebook that he/she updates regularly by pushing changes to this repository. Other members get notified in Slack when updates occur so they can check out the progress.

We discuss the work at team meetings, connect important parts, and merge them into our final result. This way we get input from all team members.

### To run the pipelines run the following command in the project root folder
`python run.py`

## Dashboard service

`mlflow ui`
